HardSurvivalStrategie
=====================

HSS, formerly HardSurvivalStrategie, is a Minecraft data pack with realistic behaviour and crafting.<br>
Many machines are designed to work as close as possible to vanilla, maintaining the aspects of the base game and implementing new mechanics.

The project is still in `Alpha`, so, there are things to add/update.<br>
Also, the project will continuously be getting updated when Minecraft get a official update itself.

Reference about the data pack can be seen through the [wiki](https://github.com/SimplyCEO/HardSurvivalStrategie/wiki).

Requirements
------------

This data pack needs the [HardSurvivalStrategie Resource Pack](/resource_pack/) to work properly.

Installation
------------

- Data pack:

Move the data pack into your world's `datapacks` folder `.minecraft/saves/world_name/datapacks/`.<br>
Be sure that the data pack is true root (eg.: `data`, `pack.mcmeta`) inside a ZIP archive.

- Resource pack:

Move the resource pack into your minecraft's `resourcepacks` folder `.minecraft/resourcepacks/`.<br>
Be sure that the resource pack is true root (eg.: `assets`, `pack.mcmeta`, `pack.png`) inside a ZIP archive.
